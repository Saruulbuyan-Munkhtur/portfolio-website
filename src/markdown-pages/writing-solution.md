Life is full of problems and unmet desires. No one is disputing this fact. What we will be discussing today is how we should go about trying to solve these problems.

Each and every one of us is facing his or her own issues. Often, we end up looking online for solutions to these problems we encounter. *As helpful and as abundant of information the internet may be, it’s not a one-all true fix all.*

Our individual problems are far too unique for there to be this magical blog post or YouTube video detailing exactly how to go by solving that problem.

# **We must all take agency of our own lives because no one else can or will.**

We have all had this realization or have yet to have it. We are the sole proprietors of the bodies we inhabit. **It’ll be through your will and initiative that will determine your life outcomes.**

How do we go by solving our own problems? You’d think that we’d have already solved them by now if we were capable of doing so. Just thinking about your problems is like running around a loop - you may think that you’ve gone far, but in actuality you keep ending in the same place.

By writing down your thoughts, it ends pesky thought loops by forcing your brain to continuously apply for reason and logic. This reason and logic are exactly what you’d need in most to all the problems you may ever deal with. **It starts with you simply writing down exactly what you’re thinking.** As you write, your thoughts and in turn the problem you’re facing start becoming ever more so clear.

With a clearer view of your problems, you can start developing your thoughts further. This is a self-enforcing process that either culminates in the end with a solution or more often even more questions to answer that’ll consist of the following:

1. Questions that can be answered by a simple google search
2. Questions that are different, but on par with the complexity of the original
3. Questions that are much more deep-rooted that’ll require much more reflection, critical thinking, and dare I say soul searching

*Either which way, having done this, you’ll be much better off than before.* Keep going after these problems one by one. Split them up. Search for their root causes. Don’t leave a stone unturned.

# **How to actually start writing**

Writing is difficult, there’s no question there. However, it is in the pain of facing said difficulty where we’re able to start growing. It’ll be a difficult hurdle to overcome, but nothing worthwhile was ever easy.

> “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.” —**David McCullough**

I never said it would be easy. I said that it will be effective.

Writing is similar to running through a brick wall to escape from the building that’s on fire. It’s something you have to do, but as difficult as it may be, the most important outcome is whether you’ve done it at all. It doesn’t matter how eloquently you’ve ran through that door or the number of bones you’ve broken in doing so. Getting out of that building alive is the only thing that matters.

I’ve been trying to form a writing habit for years now, and the only advice that’s been truly effective is write a lot of words one after the other. It doesn’t matter if it’s utter garbage, as long as the words are written by you, you’ll see improvement and you’ll see results.
