Today, I made the goal for myself to publish my first Medium post on August 19th, 2020, before 11 AM, no excuses. I’ve decided for myself that no matter how inconsistent and how imperfect the article may be that I will publish it no matter what. By doing so, I am doing one of the hardest things in the world: starting something new, all the while exposing 
yourself to criticism from others. As hard and as difficult as it may be it is a necessary step I must take.

> Start by doing what’s necessary; then do what’s possible; suddenly you are doing the impossible.

# What I hope to gain by publishing this

Notice how it is ‘publish’ instead of ‘write’. Writing as difficult and a demanding task as it is, most of what I’ve written is still safely stored in my Notion workspace free of other criticism and judgment. Publishing this article is taking something that was once private and exclusive only to my conscience and mind and is then leaving it wide open to anyone if they so choose to do so. I expect that this distinction between just writing for yourself and publishing an article for all to see is less pronounced for those more experienced. I wish to eventually get to where they are, to do what they’ve done. To even consider such a possibility, I have to take the first step and have published at least one Medium Article.

**Don’t let your goals remain far out of reach, start to take small concrete steps toward it. Remove the mental barriers limiting your potential.**

How much does publishing this article improve my writing proficiency? To be honest, not that much.

How much does it affect me mentally? More than you could know.

By publishing this article, I have something more than just the thoughts and ideas in my head or the writings I have in my Notion database. This article will be living proof of my goals and ambitions. This first step is often criminally underrated and the world would be much better off if it wasn’t.

If only there was a place where one could get such revelations and changes in perspective. Oh, wait…

## Why I want to be a part of Medium

Medium is a place where knowledge and advice are available for those who seek it and a place where I have personally benefitted from. I’ve always wanted to contribute back to the community, but what could I give back to a community so full of talented and experienced writers. However, the more I thought about it, I released something important.

**There’ll never be a lack of demand for well written unique perspectives on matters relating to the human experience.**

In the current era, content is king. There’s a lot of competing forces for our attention, but in the end, I believe quality will be rewarded. That is the standard I hope to achieve. It will be a long process that has no end, but a journey I want to embark on, regardless.

I cannot emphasize just how much I am open to feedback, criticism, or any other opinions you may have. Improvement cannot solely happen in a vacuum, and for those who not only realize this but use it to their advantage, greatness is a hop step and a pop away.
