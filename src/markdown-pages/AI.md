When the topic of AI and automation is brought up, it's often in terms of how detrimental or apocalyptic it could be. This type of framing is commonplace whenever in discussion about a possible change and especially so when the change is as distruptive as AI and automation may turn out to be. While it is right to be cautious and even sometimes fearful of change, we must not undervalue the consequences of staying stagnant.

# What is AI and automation?

Artificial intelligence is any sort of computing exhibits learning or problem solving. Automation is the use of AI and robots to replace the need of humans in performing certain actions. My argument will primarily rely on these two defnitions. 

The capabilities of automation is determined by the strength and capabilities of the AI behind it. The stronger and more capable the AI becomes, the capabilites of automation follow suite. Only after image recognition

## What is our current predicament?

The economy needs to continue growing. You may disagree about that claim, because frankly it's rather large claim for anyone to make. This is an assumption I'm making on a couple of factors which you can read here in more detail [Why the economy NEEDS to continue growing.](https://www.notion.so/Why-the-economy-NEEDS-to-continue-growing-0231f0da35e944c0b6769e6afbd38c1d) 

The basis of the argument is that the economy not growing leads to numerous problems ranging from financially and politically to societal and philosophical. It's not that the universe will collapse in on itself, but it's bascially the next worst thing. The economy needs to continue growing and quite frankly we're running out of options to do that. 

Before the industrial revolution, wealth generation came down to how much farming was done. 

## The difficulty of making technological breakthroughs are underestimated

Progress and technological progress for that matter is never guaranteed. There is no conclusive data to expect continious improvement, only loose trends that ensure nothing.
