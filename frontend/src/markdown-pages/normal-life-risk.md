Only *30 percent of businesses* will survive their 10th year in business. With these odds many wonder why even try? With such high chances of failure, why risk it? We only have one life, so why not try and be secure with what already have?

The common rebuttal to line of thinking is that life is not worth living without risks or that settling for average is limiting.

> Mediocrity is excellent to the eyes of mediocre people. — Joseph Joubert

I’m sure that you’ve seen countless quotes like the ones above that demand that average simply isn’t good enough.

Sure, this “get as much as you can” attitude may appeal to some people, but most will stick to continuing with their normal lives enjoying the little things.

After all, why should they take the risk, when they’re perfectly comfortable with their 9–5 jobs with basically all of their needs met?

This may seem reasonable until you realize just how passive this mindset is.

Instead of arguing for the benefits of an extraordinary life, I’ll be dissecting the consequences of living an average one.

# **You Stand to Remain Financially Insecure**

Starting a business is seen as such a risky choice that most barely ever consider it. They’d rather stay at their normal 9 to 5 job to avoid having to nice stable risk-free life. Except, the problem with that lies in there being no such thing as a risk-free life. There will always be those unforeseen circumstances that derail your rail if you don’t take the necessary steps to safeguard against them. Do you really want your wellbeing hinging on the whims of your boss.

By living an average life, you’re leaving yourself vulnerable to financial hardships. Imagine what a recession or an emergency medical bill could do to your finances. Living an average life means leveraging debt to have glimpses of being wealthy. By living an average life, you leave the keys to your wellbeing in your boss’s hands. That’s a risk I’m not ever willing to take.

If you’re average, that also mean that you’re replaceable.

If there are a million other people who can do your job at the same level or better than you, there’s no avoiding the fact that you can replaced — simply let go to cut costs or improve efficiency — after all it’ll be their decision.

This doesn’t mean you have to have start your own business, but it means you can never get too complacent. Make yourself valuable, indispensable, irreplaceable.

It isn’t safe to just stay where you are. Adapt, move forward, run the extra mile.

**In the end it’s all about whether you have control over your life or not.**
